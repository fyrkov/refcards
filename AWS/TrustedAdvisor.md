### Trusted Advisor
AWS Trusted Advisors provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices.\
Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks.\
These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas.\
You can then follow the check recommendations to optimize your services and resources.

Trusted Advisor helps with:
* Cost optimization. Trusted Advisor can help you save cost, such as recommending you to delete unused or idle resources, or use reserved capacity.
* Performance. Trusted Advisor can improve the performance of your services by ensuring you to take advantage of provisioned throughput, and monitoring for overutilized Amazon EC2 instances.
* Security. Trusted Advisor can improve the security of your application by recommending you to enable AWS security features, and review your permissions.
* Fault tolerance. Trusted Advisor can increase the availability of your AWS application by recommending you  to take advantage of auto scaling, health checks, multi-AZ Regions, and backup capabilities.
* Service quotas. 

Example recommendations:
* Under-utilized EC2s, EBS, idle ELBs
* SGs with unrestricted ports
* Are resources like ASG, RDS, ELB multi-AZ?
* Reaching limits for reserved EC2 instances
