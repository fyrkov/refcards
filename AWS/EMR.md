### EMR (Elastic MapReduce)
Amazon EMR is the cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto.\
EMR is used for launching Hadoop / Spark clusters.\
For short-running jobs, you can spin up and spin down clusters and pay per second for the instances used.\
For long-running workloads, you can create highly available clusters that automatically scale to meet demand.\
Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation.\
It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.
